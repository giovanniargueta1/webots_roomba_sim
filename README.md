This repo contains all the source code/materials regarding the simulation and real-life implementation of a ball-dribbling Roomba, with a custom-made ball catcher powered by OpenCV. The goal of this project was to compare the speed and accuracy of various algorithms in completing the following task- dribble two balls to two different aruco markers.
